On 1 October 2023, a new European Union (EU) measure called “Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism” (CBAM) entered into force. CBAM relates to the import of certain carbon-intensive goods, namely aluminium, iron and steel, electricity, hydrogen, fertilisers and cement, as well as certain downstream products (e.g. bolts, screws).
